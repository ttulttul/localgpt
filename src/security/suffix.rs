//! This exploits the **recency bias** of transformer models: instructions
//! near the end of the context window receive disproportionate attention.
//! By placing an immutable security reminder last, we reinforce the
//! content-boundary rules even in long sessions where the system prompt
//! has drifted into the low-attention middle zone.
